## Features

- Publish your docs to html webpage auto, while keeping all your styles. Inspired by [Webpage HTML Export](https://github.com/KosmosisDire/obsidian-webpage-export)
- COS supports: Amazon S3 or COS compatable like tencent Cloud
- **Scheduled auto sync supported.** You can also manually trigger the sync using sidebar ribbon
- Auto sync your local docs's edit with remote published html. **[Sync Algorithm open](https://github.com/remotely-save/remotely-save/blob/master/docs/sync_algorithm_v2.md) is inspired by this [project](https://github.com/remotely-save/remotely-save).**
- **Fully open source under [Apache-2.0 License](./LICENSE).**


## Limitations

- **No content-diff-and-patch algorithm.** All files and folders are compared using their local and remote "last modified time" and those with later "last modified time" wins. For example: if one file's been edited lately, it will be fully re-uploaded.

- **Cloud services cost you money.** Although COS services are easier to maintain and use, however it's important to always stay mindful of the expenses and pricing associated with different operations. This includes, but is not limited to, downloading, uploading, listing files, making API calls, and storage sizes. These actions may or may not incur charges, so it's crucial to take them into consideration.
- Your Obsidian desktop version should >= 0.13.25

## Usage


- Prepare your COS (-compatible) service information: [endpoint, region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/s3.html), [access key id, secret access key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/getting-your-credentials.html), bucket name. The bucket should be empty and solely for publishing webpages.

- Download and enable this plugin.
- Enter your information to the settings of this plugin.
- Choose the directory you want to publish in settings. Once it's been done, you'll find the directory you chose decorated with a green icon in the left file tree list.
- Click the new icon on the ribbon (the left sidebar), **every time** you want to publish your docs to remote. (Or, you could configure auto sync in the settings panel) While publishing, the icon becomes "two half-circle arrows".
- **Be patient while publishing.** Especially in the first-time publish.
- You can even share all your config above with your teammates. You can find **Export/Import** in the settings. So your teammates don't have to input such complicated keys or secret strings.
